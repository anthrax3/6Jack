6Jack's only dependency is MessagePack: http://msgpack.org/

It has been tested on OSX, OpenBSD and Linux.

OpenBSD requires support for posix_spawn():

If you fetched the code from Github instead of the .tar archive, you
also need autoconf, automake and libtools, except on OSX.
The run (this step is NOT needed if you extracted the .tar archive):

./autogen.sh

Once you have all the prerequisites, compilation and installation
should be as boring as the usual:

./configure && make install
